          <p>In React, controlled components refer to components that have their state and behavior controlled by the parent component. To modify their state and behavior, these components rely on props that are given down from the parent component. On the other hand Uncontrolled components refer to components that manage their own state internally. They use a ref to access the DOM element's current value and update the state accordingly.</p>
